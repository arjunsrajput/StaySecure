## API Endpoint Tests

Use tools like Postman or curl to test:

### Test Auth Endpoints
```bash
# Test health check
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Response should be:
# {"success":true,"message":"StaySecure API is running"}
```

### Test Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"your-admin@example.com","password":"YourStrongPass!123"}'

# Response should include an authenticated session cookie or token
```

### Test Get Rooms
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/rooms
```

---

## Common Verification Issues

### Problem: Backend won't start
- [ ] Check MongoDB is running
- [ ] Check port 5000 is not in use
- [ ] Check .env file has correct values
- [ ] Check MONGODB_URI is accessible

### Problem: Frontend won't load
- [ ] Check backend is running on http://localhost:5000
- [ ] Check both terminals are still open
- [ ] Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- [ ] Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

### Problem: Login fails
- [ ] Check database was seeded (see seed output)
- [ ] Check you're using correct credentials
- [ ] Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Problem: API calls fail
- [ ] Verify both servers running
- [ ] Check proxy in vite.config.js
- [ ] Check response in Network tab (F12)
- [ ] Verify headers including Authorization token

## Database Verification

### Check MongoDB Connection
```bash
# If using local MongoDB, connect with:
# MongoDB Compass: mongodb://localhost:27017/stay-secure
# Or using mongosh: mongosh stay-secure
```

### Verify Collections Exist
- [ ] Users collection has 7 documents
- [ ] RoomTypes collection has 5 documents
- [ ] Rooms collection has 10 documents
- [ ] Settings collection has 1 document

### Sample Query Results
```javascript
// Sample user document
{
  _id: ObjectId(...),
  name: "Admin User",
  email: "admin+demo@example.com",
  role: "ADMIN",
  phone: "9000000001",
  emailVerified: false,
  createdAt: Date
}

// Sample room document
{
  _id: ObjectId(...),
  roomNumber: "H-101",
  roomType: ObjectId(...),
  floor: 1,
  capacity: 6,
  status: "AVAILABLE",
  createdAt: Date
}
```

## Performance Checks

- [ ] Backend responds to API calls in < 100ms
- [ ] Frontend pages load in < 1 second
- [ ] No console errors (F12)
- [ ] No network errors (Network tab)
- [ ] Database operations complete quickly

---

## Security Verification

- [ ] Passwords are hashed in database (not plaintext)
- [ ] JWT tokens are in localStorage
- [ ] Logout clears token from storage
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to login without token
- [ ] Unauthorized users can't access admin pages
