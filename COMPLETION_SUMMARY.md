# 📊 Project Completion Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Built

I have created a **complete, fully-functional MERN stack** Room Booking & Accommodation Management System with the following:

---

## 🏗️ Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)

### ✅ Database Models (7 entities)
- **User** - Authentication & role management (7 roles)
- **RoomType** - Room categories (HOSTEL, PG, HOTEL, GUEST_ROOM, DORMITORY)
- **Room** - Physical rooms with status tracking
- **Booking** - Main booking entity with approval workflow
- **Allocation** - Room assignment with automatic/manual tracking
- **Payment** - Payment recording and status
- **Settings** - System configuration (approval mode)

### ✅ API Endpoints (30+ routes)
- Authentication (register, login, get current user)
- User management (CRUD operations)
- Room type management (CRUD operations)
- Room management (CRUD + availability checking)
- Booking management (create, approve, reject, cancel)
- Allocation management (manual room allocation)
- Payment management (record payments)
- Reception (check-in, check-out)
- Settings (get/update approval mode)

### ✅ Security & Middleware

- Error handling middleware
- CORS enabled
- Helmet for security headers

### ✅ Business Logic Services

- Pricing service (cost calculation)

### ✅ Database Seeding
- Script to create sample data
- 7 role-based demo users for local non-production testing only
- 5 room types with sample data
- 10 sample rooms
- All seeded credentials should be rotated and are not intended for production use

---

## 🎨 Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind CSS)

### ✅ Core Features
- User authentication (register/login)
- Role-based navigation
- Protected routes with authorization

- Admin Dashboard (system statistics)

### ✅ Services & Utilities
- **API service** - Centralized Axios configuration

## 🎯 Core Workflows Implemented

### ✅ Booking Workflow - Automatic Mode
```
1. Customer creates booking
2. System checks room availability
3. Suitable room found
4. Room auto-allocated
5. Booking CONFIRMED
6. Accountant records payment
7. Receptionist checks in
8. Receptionist checks out
```

### ✅ Booking Workflow - Manual Mode
```
1. Customer creates booking
2. Booking status: PENDING
3. Approval Manager reviews
4. If approved:
   - Room Manager allocates room
   - Booking CONFIRMED
5. If rejected:
   - Booking REJECTED
   - Reason stored
```

### ✅ Role Permissions Matrix
- **Admin** - Full access to everything
- **Customer** - Search, book, cancel own bookings
- **Room Manager** - Manage rooms, allocate rooms
- **Approval Manager** - Approve/reject bookings
- **Accountant** - Record and view payments
- **Receptionist** - Check-in/check-out
