## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Cannot connect to MongoDB"
**Fix:** Make sure MongoDB is running
- Windows: Search "MongoDB" in Start Menu and run it
- Or use MongoDB Atlas connection string

### Problem: "Port 5000 already in use"
**Fix:** Change PORT in `server/.env`
```
PORT=5001
```

### Problem: "Cannot find module"
**Fix:** Delete and reinstall:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Problem: Frontend won't load
**Fix:** Open browser console (F12) and check errors
- Ensure backend is running on http://localhost:5000
